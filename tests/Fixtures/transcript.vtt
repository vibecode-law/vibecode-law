[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.080
Part of the philosophy of Shaka is to be the easy button

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.120
and to be the everything player.

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.480
It's designed to be extensible.

5
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.960
It's designed to be flexible.

6
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.840
And for the easy stuff, it's designed to be easy to use.

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.000
If you want to have one interface that

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.080
plays dash and plays HLS.

9
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.600
And when you're stuck with native HLS on an old iPhone

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.960
version, then it'll do that too.

11
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.560
If you just want one API for all of those things,

12
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.360
that is what Shaka is.

13
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm Matt, the organizer of the SF Video Technology Meetup

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.720
and the Demux conference.

15
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.320
And I'm Steve, creator of Video.js,

16
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.160
the open source video player.

17
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.200
And I am Phil, the organizer of the London Video Technology

18
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.600
Meetup and co-organizer of Demux alongside Matt.

19
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.960
And you're listening to Demux, a podcast

20
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.800
for and by engineers working with video.

21
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560
Demux is brought to you by HeavyBit,

22
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.400
a program dedicated to helping startups take their developer

23
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.800
products to market.

24
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.320
For more information, visit heavybit.com.

25
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.880
We're always looking for topics.

26
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.040
So if you have any suggestions or just want to tell us

27
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.320
how wrong we are, you can find us on Twitter at demuxed.

28
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.160
Yeah, everyone, welcome to the next episode of the Demux

29
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.840
podcast.

30
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.080
I was looking earlier today.

31
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.600
And this is one of the rare times

32
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.480
that we've had multiple in a year, I think, at this point.

33
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.840
Officially, somebody was saying that as long as you have one

34
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.000
a year, we're not dead.

35
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.880
And so I looked in the history.

36
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.840
And in 2023, we technically died.

37
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.560
But we're back.

38
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.400
Briefly.

39
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.520
Briefly died.

40
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.440
Briefly died.

41
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.360
It is Halloween like next week.

42
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.920
So we're basically zombies now.

43
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.840
No, no, we're fully back alive because of the podcast

44
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.280
that we released relatively recently.

45
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.520
Pre-demuxed.

46
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.760
We've got a good thing going here.

47
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.520
Let's keep it going.

48
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.160
Yeah.

49
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.320
All right, today we got Joey from Shocker Player.

50
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.560
Yay.

51
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.720
Hi, everybody.

52
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.440
We just finished Demuxed.

53
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.960
Yeah, so the genesis of being able to even do this recording

54
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.320
is we figured we've got Phil in town.

55
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.640
We've got all these great attendees in town.

56
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.440
And people from the community here

57
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.800
is anybody flying out late enough

58
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.440
that we could pop in and do a quick recording.

59
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.200
So Phil is very excited to pull the recording equipment that

60
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.440
was still in boxes from getting into the office

61
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.160
from Demuxed last night.

62
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.360
And Joey doesn't fly out for another couple of hours.

63
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.680
So we figured, yeah, let's have a chat.

64
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.720
So yeah, we just finished up about 2024, the 10th one,

65
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.280
which the days are long, but the years are short and all that.

66
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.920
Yeah, congrats to you and Phil.

67
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.640
That is real accomplishment.

68
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.320
10 years.

69
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.640
I can't believe it's still going.

70
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.760
I know.

71
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.600
I wouldn't have guessed this nine years ago.

72
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.120
11 years, technically.

73
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.680
Oh, because of Demuxed.

74
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.320
Oh, because of Demuxed.

75
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.120
Yes.

76
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.280
I can't wait to field questions about whether or not

77
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.240
that was real for the next 10 years.

78
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.960
Which is weird because it's half real.

79
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.120
All the best lies are half real.

80
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.160
And also, huge shout-outs.

81
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.000
I mean, Phil did a ton of work on this thing.

82
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.200
But Victoria really held this thing together

83
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.960
with duct tape and zip ties there, especially down the stretch.

84
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.000
So huge shout-out for her part in this.

85
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.520
If you missed the conference and you want to see it,

86
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.120
or even if you were there, you want to catch up on a talk

87
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.600
that you missed, you stepped out for a little bit,

88
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.760
whatever else, as long as you have a ticket,

89
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.600
you can go watch the recordings.

90
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.720
You have exclusive access as a ticket holder through.

91
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.120
It's sad that we sometimes are scrambling hard

92
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120
to get them up by Christmas.

93
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.320
But we try and have them all.

94
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.520
We'll send them to editors.

95
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.560
We'll get like a nice final cut of all of the talks

96
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.560
with some light editing.

97
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.400
And then we'll have them on our YouTube channel.

98
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.520
And our internal drop-down date is Christmas.

99
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.240
But if you do have a ticket, Dylan and crew have actually,

100
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.280
and Justin, do a great job of like at least getting in

101
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.040
a quick clip along with chapters for each of the talks

102
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.760
you can go through and watch, at least easily find

103
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.400
and watch any of the talks you make missed.

104
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.760
It's got a cute new media chrome chapter selector as well.

105
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.640
It's really cool.

106
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.520
I was happy that got in there.

107
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.360
Me too.

108
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.240
So live.demux.com, just use your ticket code.

109
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.360
So you go to live.demux.com to get the vods.

110
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.640
Yes, it should be at a redirect to vaud.demux.com.

111
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.120
(all laughing)

112
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.960
Any favorite moments from the show this year?

113
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.720
Definitely the video tribute at the end.

114
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.520
That was incredible.

115
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.840
Yeah, yeah.

116
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.040
I really want to buy that on Blu-ray.

117
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.520
(all laughing)

118
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.280
Well, for the low-low cost of $9.99.

119
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.880
Yeah, for those who haven't seen it yet,

120
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.400
some of the demux team put together quite an impressive

121
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.040
behind the conference mockumentary.

122
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.000
Is that a mockumentary?

123
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.200
Is that the term?

124
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.840
Sure. Documentary.

125
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.000
It's like the spinal tap of video conferences.

126
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

127
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.240
Of the last 10 years and it was impressive.

128
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.440
Yeah, that was a highlight for me too.

129
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.440
And Phil made Blu-rays of every past year's demuxed,

130
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.640
including like a delightful box that has the details

131
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.640
even down to like the little tiny lettering

132
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.680
that you can barely see that talks about

133
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.880
like the producers and actors, all this sort of stuff.

134
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.760
Like has all the speakers of the, it's like,

135
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.600
oh my gosh.

136
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.680
The attention to detail is very impressive.

137
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.520
Apparently the Blu-ray menus too.

138
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.240
Oh, for the news, a fully branded,

139
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.320
all of the logos it did.

140
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.160
Yeah, everything.

141
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.800
I'm literally going like this afternoon.

142
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.600
I'm literally planning on going to GameStop

143
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.480
and buying a PlayStation 5 so I can have a Blu-ray player.

144
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.120
I've been wanting a PlayStation 5 anyway

145
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.680
and Alex has been like, do you really need one?

146
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.680
And now I can officially say, yes, I really need one.

147
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.120
I will show you later on how that font works

148
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.200
that generates all that stuff at the bottom.

149
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.520
There's a font called a universal accreditation

150
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.840
that has all those ligatures in it.

151
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.840
It's all done as like different ASCII character numbers

152
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.720
after an ASCII character code.

153
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.240
So like certain ASCII character codes will map to like

154
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.040
produced by and starring and all those sorts of things.

155
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.240
And then you have to type people's names in uppercase

156
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.200
otherwise you just get like based on a concept

157
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.800
for Star Wars and things like that in the font.

158
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.480
It's a very cool font and I will definitely use it again.

159
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.920
But yeah, I'll show you later on.

160
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.080
It's really weird.

161
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080
Cool.

162
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.200
Are there any like talks that stood out to folks?

163
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.120
Yeah, I really enjoyed YouTube's talk about TVs

164
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.480
eating your frames.

165
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.920
I loved NBCU talking about test automation.

166
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.240
The super res stuff that John presented was really cool.

167
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.640
And I've got a whole list of things that I'm going to go back

168
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.160
and watch on live.demux.com because I was downstairs

169
00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.000
in the socializing area just like making

170
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.200
so many incredible connections with so many people.

171
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.400
Like during these just these two days it's amazing.

172
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.480
Seeing old people that I've known from years past

173
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.280
and meeting new people and everybody's full of ideas

174
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.600
and wants to collaborate and everybody wants to make this

175
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.200
the best community and as much as I want to see the talks

176
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.920
like it's those connections that are irreplaceable.

177
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.280
And that's what demux really is I think.

178
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.840
The hallway track is critical.

179
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.040
I think strobes like hate to say it like every is cheating

180
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.040
to say strobes talk.

181
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.440
It's cheating to say strobes.

182
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.040
Like I feel like I think I said this to you backstage

183
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.760
I was like that just feels like the straight up

184
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.440
the best audio talk we've ever had.

185
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.080
Yeah, you must have understood a lot more of it than I did.

186
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.320
(laughing)

187
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.560
I think it was Mike saying this morning.

188
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.000
Yeah, it would have taken me three hours to explain

189
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.760
like half of what strobes covered in that sort.

190
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.920
(laughing)

191
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.680
It's just a pace he moves out my brain can't quite handle that

192
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.520
sometimes.

193
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.520
I think if strobes going to do another audio talk though

194
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.600
you need to like, you know, not film him

195
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.960
and just make him say it all.

196
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.920
I'm like, it's an audio talk about audio, right?

197
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.080
We should get him on the pod is really what we should do.

198
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.400
That's better than my thing.

199
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.240
Yeah.

200
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.720
(laughing)

201
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.440
That's better than putting a behind a black curtain

202
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.280
on stage.

203
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.000
(laughing)

204
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.160
I also really liked yinyu right?

205
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.000
Yeah.

206
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.840
Yeah.

207
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.440
And his talk on the TPZ in your frames was really fantastic.

208
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.080
I really loved that he was at Crunchyroll

209
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.320
for one of the first demux.

210
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.080
So he was talking about that like in the speaker dinner.

211
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.480
And then before we go on stage he was telling me

212
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.840
this is his first, like his first talk,

213
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.360
this is his first public speaking thing ever.

214
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.360
And that was actually the case.

215
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.400
I think there were four, at least four talks

216
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.800
where it was the speaker's first ever public speaking.

217
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.600
And every time they'd get off and be like,

218
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.240
I was so nervous it was terrible.

219
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.760
And they all killed it.

220
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.280
They all were so poised on stage.

221
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.680
I was so proud of folks executing that well

222
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.960
and like a pretty high, I mean, that's like,

223
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.840
that's not a meetup talk.

224
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.000
That's like, you know, you're sitting in front of 400 people

225
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.960
plus like, it's really cool.

226
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.880
Here, here, you haven't gone yet.

227
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.960
What's your, what was your favorite?

228
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.640
I was just thinking like what the themes were,

229
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.080
I definitely felt the theme.

230
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.240
There was at least a couple around storage,

231
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.840
like storage optimization that I thought was interesting

232
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.280
especially as like, I'm thinking about UGC content

233
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.360
a lot more and like the value of content.

234
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.880
And there is one on like very advanced optimization

235
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.560
and smart cold storage.

236
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.960
And yes, the more maths that I completely understood

237
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.160
on those equations on the stage, yeah?

238
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.600
Yeah, mm-hmm.

239
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.440
Then there was kind of a theme around noise,

240
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.800
like noise insertion, like film grain noise,

241
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.920
like I don't know, or not losing noise was another big one.

242
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.160
Like so even in like the upscale,

243
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.400
we're like, yeah, that was interesting.

244
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.720
It was weird that there was like a theme around that, but yeah.

245
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.560
Well, cool.

246
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.120
So, you know, the win here this week was getting

247
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.240
to get in a room with Joey, which is always a pleasure.

248
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.720
But this is especially fun.

249
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.360
I mean, we've got, I think, two of probably the

250
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.080
biggest online video, open source video players,

251
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.400
two originators in the same room on a podcast.

252
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.680
That's kind of neat.

253
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.360
So yeah, Joey's the creator of Shaka Player.

254
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.480
Why don't you introduce yourself, Joey?

255
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.640
Sure.

256
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.560
I'm Joey Parrish.

257
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.560
I have been working on Shaka Player for 10 years now.

258
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.680
And we started the project under Widevine

259
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.680
where Widevine had been getting a lot of feedback

260
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.200
from partners that all this newfangled dash stuff

261
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.560
was just kind of complicated.

262
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.040
And they didn't want to stop using proprietary plugins

263
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.040
when we were trying to get rid of all of those in browsers.

264
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.920
So Widevine offered to, you know, build something for that.

265
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.400
And that's where the Shaka project came from.

266
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.400
So there was actually a kind of a bigger effort proposed.

267
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.640
So I forget exactly what his title was.

268
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.200
One of our muckity mucks higher up the chain

269
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.240
had been from South Africa.

270
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.080
And he said, we need to unify all of these

271
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.080
different aspects of the media ecosystem.

272
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.280
And, you know, so for him it was inspiring

273
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.520
that Shaka had been the unifier of the Zulu people.

274
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.480
And so there was this codename Shaka project.

275
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.880
And there were three different sub projects within that

276
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.400
that were gonna like bring the easy button

277
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.720
to all these different aspects of media.

278
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.000
And so there was the player, there was the packager,

279
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.880
and there was a third project that actually never came out.

280
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.360
So got canceled and probably shouldn't say too much about it

281
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.960
because of that, but not bad.

282
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.240
So how did you get to Widevine in the,

283
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.240
like how did you come to Widevine?

284
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.360
How did I come to Widevine?

285
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.040
Yeah, so I started my Google career almost 13 years ago

286
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.440
at YouTube.

287
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.200
So I was here in the Bay Area and working on

288
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.200
the YouTube game consoles team.

289
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.600
And so that was my professional entry into video,

290
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.320
but I'd been doing some open source hacking

291
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.520
before that, Emplayer and things like that.

292
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.080
Yeah, cool.

293
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.160
I remember Emplayer.

294
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.280
Yeah, yeah, that was a good project.

295
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.200
Emplayer was my entry into video space because I,

296
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.920
in college in like 2000, 2001 type timeframe,

297
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.760
I was really desperate to turn a DVD

298
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.200
and do an animated GIF.

299
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.920
And there just was not a tool for that.

300
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.640
And my minimal research seemed like Emplayer

301
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.600
was the right tool to add that to.

302
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.120
And so that was my first open source commit as a GIF output

303
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.200
module for Emplayer.

304
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.120
But eventually, after working at some non-video startup

305
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.840
in Texas, I wound up at YouTube.

306
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.800
And then from there, I wound up at Widevine primarily

307
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.880
because I did not think I could afford

308
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.160
to buy a house in the Bay Area.

309
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.360
And Widevine was near Seattle.

310
00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.960
So it was more about a place for me

311
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.320
to move where I could afford things.

312
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.520
But I ended up being at Widevine for eight years.

313
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.560
And that was where we started, the Shaka Project.

314
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.640
And as I said before, there were three different prongs

315
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.680
of this project.

316
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.160
There was the player, the packager, and this other thing.

317
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.160
And the packager actually, I think, came out first.

318
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.080
And they decided, when they went public,

319
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.800
to name it the e-packager, which was maybe not the name

320
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.400
that everybody liked in the end.

321
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.520
But e-packager, e-dash, like little e-capital dash,

322
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.240
I guess that stood for embedded.

323
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:42.160
But it was my teammate KQ, who was involved in that.

324
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.080
And then when it was my turn to publish,

325
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.040
we had been racking our brains for six months

326
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.000
about what are we going to call this thing.

327
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.640
And we just couldn't come up with a better name

328
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.440
than the code name.

329
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.160
So we just launched it as Shaka Player.

330
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.560
And yeah, eventually, e-dash packager

331
00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.400
decided to rebrand as Shaka Packager.

332
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.320
But initially, I was not involved in the packager,

333
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.440
but over several years, needs within--

334
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.520
Widevine, within Chrome Media changed.

335
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:18.880
And that ended up coming over to my team as well, so.

336
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.080
And then about two and change years ago,

337
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.880
we moved the project over to Chromecast.

338
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.000
And that is the new home of that.

339
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.920
But as part of that process, also,

340
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.920
we didn't have quite so many resources

341
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.120
to work across all these different open source projects.

342
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.840
Chromecast is primarily concerned with playback.

343
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.880
And so we went through this transition phase

344
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.640
where it wasn't just bringing packager under the same team.

345
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.720
It was more about bringing packager in

346
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.440
and sort of trying to revive it, and then open it up,

347
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.440
and open the doors on all these projects

348
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.360
to more active contribution.

349
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.280
And it wasn't that we hadn't taken contributions before,

350
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.920
but it hadn't really been a thoughtful process before.

351
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.480
And there were days when someone

352
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.160
would have something they wanted to do in Shaka Player,

353
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.800
and I would just say, no.

354
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.720
That's not the direction that I personally want to go.

355
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.840
And that was a little short-sighted.

356
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:27.320
And the plan now is to really make all of these projects

357
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.120
as open and community-based as possible.

358
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.680
Now we have as many non-Google maintainers in Shaka Player

359
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.560
as we do Googlers working on the project.

360
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.440
So that's awesome.

361
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.440
And we went through this transition where we said, OK,

362
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.720
all this weird private Google-only stuff we're doing,

363
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.440
let's replace that, let's change that,

364
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.360
let's build on GitHub actions, let's--

365
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.200
we even have, if you're a maintainer in Shaka Player,

366
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.760
you have rights to run test passes in the private lab

367
00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.560
that we run in the Kirkland office.

368
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.200
So we have real devices instead of VMs.

369
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.120
And yeah, so just really tried to open everything up

370
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.040
and democratize everything as much as possible, because not

371
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.920
only was I kind of a benevolent dictator before,

372
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.480
but that also makes you a bottleneck.

373
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.560
And that just wasn't going to cut it.

374
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.320
So now the Packager, I believe we only

375
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.320
have one non-Google maintainer, the Shaka Packager,

376
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.880
and that has caused me in at meta.

377
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.880
And so we're still looking for more people

378
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.880
who want to contribute there and be more active

379
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.640
and choosing the direction of that project.

380
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.040
But in general, we're just trying

381
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.640
to be more community-oriented, and not just in terms

382
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.200
of who's writing code, but in terms of who's making decisions

383
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.440
and who's generating ideas.

384
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.480
And where are we going next?

385
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.360
Well, I was going to say, I have a general idea

386
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.320
of where the Shaka Player gets used,

387
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.400
but it might be worth kind of just kind of rounding that out.

388
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.920
They're like the major platforms where Shaka gets used.

389
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.760
Sure.

390
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.840
But I don't have a good idea of necessarily where

391
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.520
the Shaka Packager gets used.

392
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.160
So it'd be interesting to hear that.

393
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.560
Yeah, me neither.

394
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.600
OK.

395
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.880
That's fair.

396
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.560
I'm sure there are people with more history

397
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.520
who were involved over more of those years.

398
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.200
But so the Packager can run in two different modes.

399
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.560
You can build it as a shared library

400
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:28.160
and integrate it into your pipelines in C++ interface,

401
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.680
or you can build a command line and run it one off or script it.

402
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.280
So I imagine if you are building Shaka Packager

403
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.520
into your backend infrastructure somewhere,

404
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.760
you're going the library route and you're

405
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.400
connecting it to a bunch of other components,

406
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.320
maybe libaby codec, maybe other things.

407
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.160
Whereas the way that I tend to use it

408
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.480
is generating test content or things like that

409
00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:54.280
where it's absolutely command line running on one machine,

410
00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.680
haven't heard of the cloud.

411
00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.160
But yeah, I definitely had it anecdotally

412
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.120
that there were media partners.

413
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.000
Back when KQ was running the project,

414
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.120
there were media partners who were integrating Shaka Packager

415
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.680
into their backends.

416
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.360
Unfortunately, I don't have relationships

417
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.160
with those companies on that thing.

418
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.360
So that kind of context has unfortunately

419
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.120
been lost in the transfer of ownership.

420
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.320
It's the unfortunate thing about open source

421
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.760
is that unless you are really particular about building

422
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.560
in some sort of tracking or analytics,

423
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.280
you just don't know who's using it or how.

424
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.040
And none of the Shaka projects report back to us.

425
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.880
So until someone gets a bug and needs help with something.

426
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.720
Yes.

427
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.560
And then they pop in and it's like,

428
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.880
whoa, you're using this?

429
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.720
Yeah, great.

430
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.920
Good to know.

431
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.280
Yeah, I'll sit back and tell the story without naming names.

432
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.640
But I got an email once from somebody on their Gmail account

433
00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.800
and they were like, hey, I need help with this Shaka player

434
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.480
thing, I don't like this, I don't like that.

435
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.680
I don't think it should go like this, yada, yada, yada.

436
00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:02.240
And I read it and I thought about it and I replied and I said,

437
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.440
those are all really great ideas.

438
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.080
I actually love all of this feedback.

439
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.320
I agree with you about all of these things.

440
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.040
But yeah, we can't, there's, I don't have the time to do that.

441
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.040
And then they replied back from their corporate account

442
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.840
and they were like, well, I'm with this company.

443
00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.920
How about now?

444
00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.440
And I was like, oh, it's so amazing.

445
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.120
I had no idea you guys were our users.

446
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.720
But no, I mean, you're not paying us.

447
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.120
It doesn't change anything.

448
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.680
I know.

449
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.920
Yeah, people are people are real funny and cagey around this stuff,

450
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.680
especially when all the Shaka projects started under wide

451
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.360
vine really being promoted by wide vine.

452
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.360
There's sort of a culture of secrecy around DRM and premium

453
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:41.880
content.

454
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.840
So people report bugs and you say, well,

455
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.160
how do I reproduce your bug?

456
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.000
And they're like, well, we can't tell you.

457
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.440
Like, well, that's going to be fun.

458
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.440
My gosh.

459
00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.000
You're talking about a little, kind of,

460
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.880
mentioned like finding packages, hard to use.

461
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.720
But I guess one interesting place that Shaka is now really

462
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.240
signed to be used is a replacement on Chromecast, right?

463
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:03.960
Right.

464
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.240
Yeah.

465
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:10.280
So Shaka is the default player for dash content on Chromecast.

466
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.800
And there's a proprietary player that's still the default for HLS.

467
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.600
But we're going to be changing that soon.

468
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.360
So you can already opt in if you have a Chromecast receiver app.

469
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.560
You can opt in to use Shaka for HLS.

470
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.440
And we'd really encourage everyone to do that at the very

471
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.560
least on a staging instance or something like that.

472
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.200
So you can find out if there are problems that maybe we don't

473
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:34.680
know about.

474
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.400
You can report them before this becomes the global default.

475
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.360
But we will be doing a sort of a staged rollout, experiment,

476
00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.080
gather some data, and see what will actually happen when we

477
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.600
change the default.

478
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.200
And either then or now, in addition to opting in early, you

479
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.600
can opt out early.

480
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.840
If you know there's problems, you can say, I insist on holding

481
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.280
off on this change.

482
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.440
But as long as your app sets an explicit flag, we're not

483
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.080
going to change that.

484
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.360
But the default, if you don't set that flag, will be changing

485
00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.600
in the next, I'm going to guess six months.

486
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.840
Does that mean you're going to be maintaining two different

487
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.960
ways moving forward?

488
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.360
Play HLS?

489
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.080
No, no.

490
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.080
The old way is not really going to be maintained anymore.

491
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:22.880
Got it, yeah.

492
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.760
That's a big part of the motivation to make this switch

493
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.320
is that it allows us to put more of our frankly limited

494
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.360
resources into one unified platform.

495
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.000
And then there's also an advantage for the customer, too,

496
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.600
because the Shaka player is actually decoupled from the

497
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.240
Chromecast SDK.

498
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.920
So in your receiver app, when you configure the SDK at the

499
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.620
very beginning of the startup of your app, one of the flags

500
00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.640
you can set before it loads anything is what version of

501
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.080
Shaka player do you want to load?

502
00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:01.120
And so if we fix something in the player, I can push out

503
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.120
Shaka player release in a day.

504
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.520
And we get maybe two releases a year of the Chromecast SDK.

505
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.000
So if the bug is in the player, we can push that out.

506
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.760
You can get that fixed in a matter of days.

507
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.360
And if we are busy, you can contribute to that player,

508
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.640
which you could not do with the old one.

509
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.400
Right?

510
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.000
Yeah, super cool.

511
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.520
Part of what you're saying there, I'm trying to

512
00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.680
try to grow that tent to be a little bit less Google

513
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.840
centric around the contributions.

514
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.000
Don't have to put words in Steve's mouth, but I assume

515
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.760
he would agree with most of what I'm about to say around.

516
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.280
I mean, we tried really hard with Video.js to encourage

517
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.960
and foster external contributions.

518
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.840
You know, we tried a good first issue tag.

519
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.840
We tried to lower that barrier to acceptance as far as possible.

520
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:59.080
I think as far as I could tell, I think the only things

521
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.280
that really worked were Steve, just like getting a pull request,

522
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.480
be like, great, thank you.

523
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.200
And then doing a ton of work to just fix it and make it good

524
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.040
enough to pull in and then pull it in.

525
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.240
Rather than trying to do the back and forth

526
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.480
with the maintainer, that's exactly what attention is.

527
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:22.160
'Cause you want to bring a contributor in deeper

528
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.400
and help them navigate the code base,

529
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.280
help them learn how to do things, train them.

530
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.600
And that is a lot of time.

531
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.720
Yeah, it takes a lot of work.

532
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.120
But you also want to help them get the win, right?

533
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.120
So it's like, okay, if we help them get the first quick win

534
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.320
and get a PR merged, well, they stick around

535
00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.400
and now we can help them do this,

536
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.080
self-service more than next time,

537
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.200
or just curious, what tax have you been trying

538
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.600
and what's been working on that front?

539
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.360
All over that map, I've done everything

540
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.320
that you've just said at some point.

541
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.320
I will probably do it all again at some point,

542
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.080
but it's like when you hire somebody

543
00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.920
and you have a new teammate and you could take the attitude

544
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.880
of like, well, I don't have time to teach this person.

545
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.600
I have my own stuff to do.

546
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.320
But it's like that time you invest in them

547
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.800
as a multiplier for your whole organization.

548
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.480
It's worth it, you know?

549
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.960
And it's the same's true in open source, you know?

550
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.160
It's like, if somebody said it would be something

551
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.080
that's way off base, but they want to be there,

552
00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.240
it's worth it long-term for me to teach them if I can.

553
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.160
And so I think that, you know, part of being

554
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.160
an open source maintainer, in my view,

555
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.480
it's one part technical and it's one part organizational

556
00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.440
and it's also, to some degree, like educational.

557
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.440
Like, you need to be a teacher sometimes.

558
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.800
Yeah, I totally agree with that.

559
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.280
And also, video players are hard in that

560
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.600
for a lot of users of video players,

561
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.440
they're just trying to get the video working.

562
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.680
They might find a bug and contribute it,

563
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.920
but then if they're an application developer,

564
00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.640
then they're just like moving on to the next,

565
00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.240
like component in their system that might have problems

566
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.760
and like, unlikely to continue to be a contributor.

567
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.800
Like, fabulous to be like a media streaming platform

568
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.440
or something like that, then that's like a clear place

569
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.640
where you might, you know,

570
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.400
get somebody to contribute on a regular basis.

571
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.320
But like, once you get to like the application developer level,

572
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.800
like, it's not like a react or something like that,

573
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.320
where it's like, you're working in this thing every day,

574
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.960
it's like this video player that once you get it working,

575
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.520
you're moving on and that could be a challenge

576
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.920
in this kind of niche space.

577
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.600
Yeah, it's a very niche space.

578
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.320
And like a lot of the people who use at least my products

579
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.000
are people who work for big streaming media companies.

580
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Like, you know, random developers don't need dash, you know.

581
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.440
I've had so many people come and say like,

582
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.120
hey, I just stumbled across your projects.

583
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.880
I'm looking for a video player for my website.

584
00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:48.120
And you know, my family videos are like my training video

585
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.200
for my employee or whatever.

586
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.000
And you know, I try to take time and explain to them like,

587
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.720
yeah, I really don't think this is the project you need.

588
00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.520
Like this is, I'm happy to point you at some resources

589
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.880
about HTML5 video, but like, you don't need this.

590
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.440
This is a lot of complexity that doesn't serve you.

591
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.760
You know, contributors do tend to be

592
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.760
from these big companies.

593
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:13.600
And so like there is an opportunity to get them,

594
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.560
if you can, you know, influence the not just the people,

595
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.720
but the companies to take the attitude of like,

596
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.480
well, this is a public good for our whole industry

597
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.720
and like we should be, we should be here.

598
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.400
So I mean, and this is not intended

599
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.680
to be rolling a grenade out of the room or anything,

600
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.480
but I'm just curious.

601
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.280
I mean, two amazing projects, HLSJS and Shaka,

602
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.160
like why would you pull Shaka off the shelf

603
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.760
over HLSJS or vice versa?

604
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.040
- You know, I'm not sure what the big advantages are

605
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.600
of HLSJS over Shaka.

606
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.280
I haven't spent a lot of time in their source code

607
00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.120
and I haven't used it personally.

608
00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.960
I am sure there are advantages to HLSJS over Shaka.

609
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.600
You know, as I'm, as I'm sure there are vice versa.

610
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.560
Part of the philosophy of Shaka is to be the easy button

611
00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.760
and to be the everything player.

612
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.200
And so, you know, it's designed to be extensible,

613
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.680
it's designed to be flexible

614
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.720
and for the easy stuff, it's designed to be easy to use.

615
00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.040
You know, I'm sure some of those things

616
00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.080
are also true of the other project.

617
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.120
But, you know, if you wanna have one interface

618
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.000
that plays dash and plays HLS and when you're, you know,

619
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.360
stuck with native, you know, native HLS

620
00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.840
on an old iPhone version, then you know, it'll do that too.

621
00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.800
If you just want one API for all of those things,

622
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.320
that is what Shaka is.

623
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.320
- So, an area that we're getting pushed on lately

624
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.720
when we're thinking about players is size, oh yeah.

625
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.280
And so, you know, where we've gotten pushed is like,

626
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.160
yeah, I mean, this player looks nice and all,

627
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.160
but like, it's X kilobytes, G-zipped, blah, blah.

628
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.480
That's way too much.

629
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.320
- Yeah.

630
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.280
- I'm curious, are y'all getting pushed on that at all?

631
00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.680
Is it a concern? - Oh yeah.

632
00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.680
- Yeah, I've been hearing people talk about this for years.

633
00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.600
- Well, it's gone in and out, to be fair, like, you know,

634
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.520
I feel like there was a little bit where

635
00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.000
that was just like a little bit less of a concern.

636
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.240
Like, connections had gotten fast.

637
00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.680
There was the spend as little as possible

638
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.200
that it felt like we didn't have the focus on that.

639
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.080
Now it feels like we've gone fully back to the,

640
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.000
oh yeah, Perf sent as little JavaScript as possible.

641
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.640
- Yeah, I think a lot of that has come from accurate

642
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.000
or inaccurate, the perception that like,

643
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.040
the like, lighthouse metrics have like, dramatic impact

644
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.760
on like, page ranks. - Yeah.

645
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.640
- And I think like, a lot of people now

646
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.960
trying to load video players like above the fold,

647
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.880
background videos, you know, aesthetic videos

648
00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.920
that are part of the page, right?

649
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.640
And maybe I'm optimizing those for like a lazy load

650
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.160
or that sort of thing, like something we've,

651
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.280
we've been now the rabbit hole of extensively.

652
00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.040
I think that has driven people back to like,

653
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.520
reducing play as I, like trying to get her down

654
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.440
as low as possible.

655
00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.600
- Yeah, so I've heard complaints over the years

656
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.760
about the size of Shaka, but I haven't done this in a while,

657
00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.560
but at the time when I went and compared

658
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.280
to some other open source players

659
00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:04.080
that did similar or same things, they were bigger.

660
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.360
And so, you know, yeah, Shaka is big

661
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.240
and it's gotten bigger over time

662
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.520
because we've added a lot more features.

663
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.880
But one of the things we built in kind of early

664
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.240
and I'll be the first to admit

665
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.640
that our build system is jank,

666
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.520
but this custom build system we have,

667
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.760
it outputs a monolithic build,

668
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.440
but at build time you can customize

669
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.960
what pieces go into that model I think build.

670
00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.400
So it's not modular in the way

671
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.880
that you would want it to be modular.

672
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.240
That's something we're talking about

673
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.640
for the next year to be able to

674
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.960
make it more modular, more composable

675
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.480
and move to TypeScript.

676
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.560
I think all of those things go hand in hand.

677
00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.840
But, you know, today you can run the build script

678
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.400
and say, you know, I want the complete build

679
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.600
and then I want you to subtract the UI

680
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.960
and I want you to subtract cast

681
00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.120
and I want you to subtract offline.

682
00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.880
Or you can just say, I only want dash

683
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.840
and I only want, you know, this other thing.

684
00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.080
I only want this subtitle format, you know.

685
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.480
So you can do a custom build today

686
00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.960
and strip it down to the pieces that you need.

687
00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.000
And in that sense, it is modular,

688
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.200
but we could do a lot more

689
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.440
and we could do a lot better and we plan to.

690
00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.400
Captions, like that's one that comes up a lot

691
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.160
when we look at it and it's why I think quite a lot

692
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.560
of people that visit video.js build without captions.

693
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.800
Just because that's actually a good chunk

694
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.560
of a bundle size at this stage.

695
00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.560
- Yeah, it's always blew my mind.

696
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.280
I remember they're like, it's rendering text.

697
00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.120
How hard could it be?

698
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.160
And then like you really look under the hood

699
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.960
and there's like basically a video game engine

700
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.840
and they're around like collision detection

701
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.360
and all this other crazy stuff.

702
00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:36.160
So it makes sense once you scratch the surface.

703
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.800
But wow, that doesn't remind me though.

704
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.720
Shaka has, this is getting pretty technical, I think,

705
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.320
but like Shaka has an interesting way.

706
00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.440
I think of handling text tracks in the absence

707
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.640
of the remove text track API and that like other players

708
00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.920
just like deal with the fact that there's like,

709
00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.040
once you create a text track, you can't remove them.

710
00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.680
Whereas I think in Shaka, like you found a nice way

711
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.920
to kind of juggle that, reuse them, is that right?

712
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.840
- Yeah, yeah.

713
00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.520
So there's two different ways to display text by default,

714
00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.360
but it's a plugin interface so you can add your own.

715
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.560
But one of them uses the text track interface

716
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.960
and just like we take Dash and HLS,

717
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.440
we boil it down to an internal sort of intermediate

718
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.520
representation that has all the things from both.

719
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.640
We do the same with text.

720
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.680
So we'll parse VTT, we'll parse TTML, we'll parse.

721
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.160
Oh, I can't even remember, Alvaro has added

722
00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.400
so many subtitle formats now that I had no involvement in,

723
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.920
but they all boil down to the same

724
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.520
and intermediate internal representation.

725
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.840
And then if you are displaying through the text track

726
00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.720
interface, those all get down converted further

727
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.720
into the VTTQ API, which is limited

728
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.120
and the implementations of it are even more limited

729
00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.120
than the spec because even Chrome doesn't implement

730
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.640
everything that's in VTTQ.

731
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.560
But when we're doing that, the player will basically

732
00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.080
create a single text track.

733
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.200
And if you switch text tracks at the high level,

734
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.160
the player, that underlying HTML text track

735
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.800
is just getting cleared and reused.

736
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.200
And when it starts up, if you're running like player

737
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.480
instance after player instance, they're each picking up

738
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.320
the same track object on that video element.

739
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.760
If you're reusing the video element,

740
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.240
you're reusing that text track.

741
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.800
So we just don't have a problem with that.

742
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.000
And if we find other older text tracks on that video element

743
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.280
that somebody else created, we just disable them.

744
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.040
Oh, yeah.

745
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.080
So it's only the ID on it that says like,

746
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.040
Chaka Player, that's ours, we control that.

747
00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.800
Speaking of text earlier, y'all have

748
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.120
done a ton of translation work within Chaka.

749
00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:43.880
Yes.

750
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.240
What is your favorite translation?

751
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.160
Well, I think that's obviously the UI translation

752
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.240
into Ancient Elbeish.

753
00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.640
So somebody's asked me before like what the story is

754
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.120
with the one-star track clip that's on there.

755
00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.320
So I'll do that first because there's a lead in here.

756
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.160
But at the time we started the Chaka Player project,

757
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.880
I couldn't find any multi-lingual test content,

758
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.840
like specifically audio.

759
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.400
But I had lived in Germany.

760
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.760
And I owned a Region 2 DVD of Star Trek.

761
00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.200
And it had all the e-figs, audio tracks.

762
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.120
And so I said, OK, let me just see

763
00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.360
if I can figure out what fair use means.

764
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:29.160
And I will take this SD 60 second clip in all the languages.

765
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.600
And we'll just add that to our test content

766
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:37.240
and hope that nobody paying attention to this is a lawyer.

767
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.320
So we created this test clip with Star Trek.

768
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.480
And for me, I'm a giant Trek-y.

769
00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.000
But then the project grows, the team grows.

770
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.840
And at some point, one of my teammates

771
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.840
was like, how come everything you're doing is Star Trek?

772
00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.400
What about my fandoms?

773
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.960
[LAUGHTER]

774
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.880
And she was the one who was really designing the UI library

775
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.720
and working on all the UX stuff.

776
00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.680
And so when we had to start, we didn't

777
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.440
have to think about internationalization

778
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.000
when Chaka was just an API.

779
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.480
But now we had our own UI.

780
00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.800
We had our own text showing up in that UI.

781
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:18.000
And even the screen reader text even had to be translated.

782
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.480
So as an Easter egg, we had this available,

783
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.080
I believe, when we launched the UI in 2018

784
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.120
was the Cinder and Translation.

785
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.160
It wasn't originally in the repo.

786
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.800
Initially, it was only secretly inserted

787
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.680
into the AppSpot deployment so that nobody knew it was there.

788
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.120
But if you typed in the language code SJN,

789
00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.520
you would get the UI translated into Cinder.

790
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.600
And that is actually the language code for Elvish

791
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.600
that has been set aside as an ISO language code for them.

792
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.240
Oh, my gosh.

793
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.320
Is that BCP47 compliant?

794
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:48.960
Yes, it is.

795
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.960
[LAUGHTER]

796
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.200
So yeah, as part of the process of getting rid

797
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.800
of Google inside baseball for Chaka Player,

798
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.200
we put everything in the repo, including all the Easter eggs.

799
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.200
And I just recently had to go through an update

800
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.000
because we've added a lot of things to the UI.

801
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.160
So I had to go update all of our Cinder and Translations.

802
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.680
But basically, there's a web font that loads on demand

803
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.480
whenever that Unicode range gets hit.

804
00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.720
And there's an actual Elvish font.

805
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.160
So if you're not a Tolkien nerd, the Elvish language,

806
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.520
there was like ancient Elvish.

807
00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.800
And then there was like everyday walking around modern Elvish

808
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.880
at the time that the stories take place.

809
00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.920
And then there's Tanguar, which is the writing system.

810
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.280
The writing system is phonetic.

811
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.680
You can write English in Tanguar.

812
00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.120
It's totally divorced from the actual language.

813
00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.400
So I could have just taken those English strings

814
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.160
and rendered them in the Tanguar font.

815
00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.560
And I did not do that.

816
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.520
I actually spent time not being a speaker of Elvish

817
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.440
going through finding internet resources,

818
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.640
online dictionaries, grammar guides,

819
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:58.560
and doing my level best to actually translate these things.

820
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.880
And where I've made mistakes in the Elvish,

821
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.640
I'm very happy to have pull requests.

822
00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.400
The commitment here is amazing.

823
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.040
I know.

824
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.800
This is fantastic.

825
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.600
So it was very hard for me to keep track of all this.

826
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.240
At one point, I had a spreadsheet.

827
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.040
And then I couldn't get the font surrender in the spreadsheet.

828
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.040
But I eventually ended up putting an extra file in the repo

829
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.600
that's next to the actual translation file

830
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:25.120
that's much broader and has the original language,

831
00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.480
the original English string, then a literal translation

832
00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.360
of that of the words I could find in Elvish.

833
00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.120
And then those Elvish words in Roman letters

834
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.160
and then those in the actual Unicode range

835
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.360
for the Tanguar script.

836
00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:45.760
And so my favorite translation, someone asked me this week,

837
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.200
what's your favorite translation?

838
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.800
I said, well, it's the skip add button, which literally says,

839
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.960
jump over request for money.

840
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.520
[LAUGHTER]

841
00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:02.080
So yeah, I got to do a lot of creative translating.

842
00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.320
I'm looking at the source here.

843
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.320
AirPlay is another fun one.

844
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.320
It literally says, heavens make play.

845
00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.440
[LAUGHTER]

846
00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.680
It's the best we could do.

847
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.720
So yeah, you can go to the Shaka demo today

848
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.960
and go to the config, pull the config out.

849
00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.840
And that little drawer, go to UI language and type in SJN.

850
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.360
And then I don't think there's any Elvish screen readers.

851
00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.720
But even those get translated.

852
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.400
So amazing.

853
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.040
Fantastic.

854
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.960
Yeah.

855
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.680
So you asked in there, if anybody listening maybe

856
00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.680
are fluent in Elvish, they could contribute changes.

857
00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.160
Yeah.

858
00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.760
Yeah, tell us more about getting on to the contribution train.

859
00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.600
OK, so there's a very complicated set of command line

860
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.400
tools and emails that you have to use.

861
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.800
[LAUGHTER]

862
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.240
No, we take pull requests on GitHub.

863
00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.080
It is a relatively straightforward process.

864
00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.920
We're not strict about file an issue

865
00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.000
before you send a pull request, although if your pull request

866
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
is going to be complex, maybe have a conversation with us

867
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.880
before you do some big architecture.

868
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.920
But we don't have strict rules about that.

869
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.680
I know some people like they like to file an issue

870
00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.600
and then immediately file a PR to close it.

871
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.200
That's cool.

872
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.480
We love that too.

873
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.760
But yeah, just send us pull requests.

874
00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.000
We like those.

875
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.520
Any-- I mean, do you all do-- I know some Google projects

876
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.360
have to do the ownership stuff.

877
00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.360
I'm just curious.

878
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.880
So yeah, we do have-- it is Google policy

879
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.640
that we have a CLA.

880
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.800
There are conscientious objectors in the community

881
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.320
who will file issues with little snippets of code

882
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.160
and then refuse to send PRs because they

883
00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.960
don't want to sign a CLA.

884
00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.440
And I'm not going to fight anybody on that

885
00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:49.600
if you don't want to assign this legal document.

886
00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.480
That is totally between you and Google.

887
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.400
It's not my policy.

888
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.240
It's Google's policy.

889
00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.240
But yeah, you do have to sign a CLA technically.

890
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.880
And the other maintainers do tend to check.

891
00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.680
But there's actually a robot like a CI action that comes along

892
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.840
and says, hey, I noticed you haven't signed the CLA.

893
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.680
So they make it really hard for us to not notice.

894
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.840
We're coming up on time here.

895
00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.080
But anything else you wanted to cover?

896
00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.680
No, not really.

897
00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.680
I'm really grateful to be part of this community.

898
00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.720
And I'm really grateful to be involved in Chaka

899
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.080
all these years.

900
00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.120
I want to keep it going.

901
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.640
I want to keep the community going.

902
00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.240
I want to grow the community aspect as much as possible.

903
00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.560
And yeah, happy to have everybody involved

904
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.000
who wants to be involved.

905
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.480
Awesome.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.560
