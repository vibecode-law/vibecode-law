# Responsible Vibecoding

## Build Fast. Think First.

Vibecoding is brilliant for ideas, prototypes, and mini-apps. It lets you go from problem to working demo in hours. But it comes with responsibilities, especially in legal tech.

Here are our ground rules.

---

## 1. Never Use Real Data

Do not use confidential, privileged, or personal data when building, testing, or demoing your projects. Use synthetic or made-up data at every stage.

## 2. Know What It Is (and Isn't)

Vibecoded projects are experiments and prototypes. They are not production software. Be upfront about that - with yourself and anyone who uses what you build.

## 3. Don't Replace Professional Judgement

Vibecoded tools should assist people, not make decisions for them or give professional advice.

## 4. Think About Who Could Be Affected

What happens if your tool gives the wrong answer? Could someone rely on it to their detriment? Legal technology touches real people with real problems. Build with that awareness.

## 5. Be Honest

Describe what your project actually does. If it only works for one jurisdiction, say so. If the AI sometimes gets it wrong, warn people. The legal profession runs on trust.

## A Note for Regulated Professionals

If you are a practising lawyer or other regulated professional, your existing professional obligations apply to your vibecoding activities. Vibecoding is a tool. You remain responsible for how you use it.

---

## In Short

Vibecoding is for exploring ideas and building prototypes. Keep real data out. Be honest about limitations. Think about impact. That's responsible vibecoding.
