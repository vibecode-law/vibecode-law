# About vibecode.law

vibecode.law is a community-driven platform where those in legal learn to vibecode, showcase their projects, discover others', and connect with others transforming the legal industry through technology. 

We're realistic about what vibecoding can achieve. Projects built by non-developers through AI-assisted coding aren't production-ready out of the box. They may contain bugs, security gaps, and architectural decisions that need professional refinement. 

But that's not the point. Vibecoding is a catalyst for change: it lets legal professionals demonstrate ideas rather than just describe them, validate concepts before investing in full development, and communicate precisely what they need through working prototypes. 

The cost of experimentation has collapsed, and ideas that would have died in committee can now be tested in reality.

The path forward is vibecoding alongside professional development. A developer handed a working prototype understands the vision instantly. They can focus their expertise on security and scalability rather than requirements gathering.
