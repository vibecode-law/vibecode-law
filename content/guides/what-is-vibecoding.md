# What is Vibecoding?

## The Short Version

Vibecoding is building software by describing what you want in plain language and letting AI write the code for you. Instead of learning programming syntax, you have a conversation with an AI assistant, explain your idea, and watch it come to life.

The term was coined by Andrej Karpathy (former Director of AI at Tesla and founding member of OpenAI) in February 2025:

> "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."

## How It Works

Traditional software development requires years of training to master programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Vibecoding flips this model:

1. **You describe** what you want to build in natural language
2. **AI generates** the code based on your description
3. **You review and refine** through conversation
4. **AI iterates** until you have a working application

The barrier to entry has collapsed. If you can clearly articulate a problem and its solution, you can build software. Now, whether that software is ready for production release? We'll come onto that.

## Why "Vibe"?

The name captures the essence of the approach: you're coding based on the *vibe* of what you want rather than the precise technical specifications. You might say:

*"I want a tool that helps me track time entries and formats them for billing"*

Rather than:

*"Create a React application with a PostgreSQL database using a REST API with authentication middleware..."*

The AI handles the technical translation. You focus on the outcome.

## Vibecoding vs Traditional Development

| Aspect | Traditional Development | Vibecoding |
|--------|------------------------|------------|
| **Skills Required** | Programming languages, frameworks, debugging | Clear communication, problem definition |
| **Time to Prototype** | Days to weeks | Minutes to hours |
| **Code Understanding** | Deep understanding required | May have limited visibility |
| **Maintenance** | Controlled, documented | Can be challenging |
| **Quality Assurance** | Established practices | Requires new approaches |
| **Best For** | Production systems, enterprise software | Prototypes, internal tools, experiments |

## The Legal Tech Opportunity

For legal professionals, vibecoding represents a paradigm shift. Lawyers understand legal problems intimately but have historically needed to rely fully on technologists to build solutions. 

The people who understand legal problems best can now contribute to building solutions directly.

## What Can You Build?

Vibecoded legal tech projects on this platform span the full spectrum:

### Document Automation
- Contract generators and templates
- Demand letter creators
- NDA builders

### Practice Management
- Time tracking tools
- Client intake forms
- Deadline calculators

### Legal Research
- Statute trackers
- Research organisers
- Citation formatters

### Client Tools
- Fee estimators
- Case status portals
- Appointment schedulers

### Compliance & Risk
- Policy checkers
- Regulatory monitors
- Risk assessment tools

## The Vibecoding Mindset

Successful vibecoding requires a shift in thinking:

### Think in Outcomes, Not Implementation
Focus on *what* you want it to do and *why*.

### Iterate Rapidly
Your first version won't be perfect. Vibecoding enables fast iteration. Get something working, then refine.

### Embrace Experimentation
The cost of trying an idea is now measured in hours, not months. Test more hypotheses.

### Stay Critical
AI-generated code may contain errors or security issues. Always review outputs and don't use it with confidential or personal data without getting expert assistance. 

## Limitations to Understand

Vibecoding is powerful but not magic. Be aware:

- **AI can hallucinate**: Generated code may look correct but contain subtle bugs
- **Production systems are much harder**: Simple tools might look great; enterprise architecture is another matter
- **Security requires expertise**: AI may not implement security best practices
- **Maintenance can be difficult**: If you don't understand the code, fixing it later is hard
- **Not production-ready by default**: Most vibecoded projects need significant work before professional deployment
